# MATLAB Codes

In this repository, I have used MATLAB to code some projects mostly related to fluid flow pressure drop through pipes and porous medias.

# 1. Pressure-Drop-Drilling

It is a project related to fluid mechanics and fluid flow calculations.
The files contain MATLAB scripts and functions.
These files are part of a project for analyzing pressure loss, velocities, and other parameters in drilling fluid flow scenarios.
The aim of this project is to develop computational models or algorithms for simulating fluid flow behavior in a well and its annular geometries
, considering different flow regimes and rheological properties of the fluid.

# 2. Pressure-Drop-Flow-Regiems

This ia a project related to fluid flow calculations and analysis.
The files contain MATLAB scripts and functions with names like "Derivative.m," "FlowPatternAndPressureDrop_Deviated.m," "Friction_Factor.m," and others.
These files are part of a project (computational tool) aimed at studying and predicting flow patterns, pressure drops, and other relevant parameters in different fluid flow scenarios.
The project's objective is to develop numerical methods, algorithms, and models to analyze and simulate fluid flow behavior in various systems, such as vertical pipes, deviated pipes, or general flow situations.
The calculations and functions implemented in these files involve concepts like friction factors, viscosity, Reynolds number, and flow pattern correlations.

# 3. Pressure-Drop-WellTest

As a project related to reservoir engineering or reservoir simulation,
The files include MATLAB scripts and functions such as "AavgFunction.m," "FVFFunction.m," "KrFunction.m," and others, as well as Excel files with various data.
The aim of this project is to develop a numerical model to analyze and predict the behavior and pressure profile of a reservoir, including parameters such as porosity, permeability, fluid viscosities, pressure, flow rates, and skin factors.
The files contain functions to calculate average values, fluid flow fractions, relative permeabilities, mobility factors, and other properties relevant to reservoir engineering.
The Excel files may contain data inputs or outputs for the simulation, such as reservoir properties, well parameters, boundry conditions, and spatial dimensions.
Overall, the project's objective could be to simulate fluid flow and reservoir performance to support decision-making in oil and gas reservoir management.
this project is seperated to three parts:
(1) one phase fluid flow in one dimensional environment (1D-1P),
(2) one phase fluid flow in two dimensional environment (2D-1P), and
(3) two phase fluid flow in two dimensional environment (2D-2P)

# 4. PVT

It is a PVT (Pressure-Volume-Temperature) analysis project in the context of reservoir engineering (Chemical engineering).
The files include MATLAB scripts and functions such as "PRStability.asv," "PRStability.m," "visc.m," and others, as well as Excel files and text files.
The aim of this project could be to develop a code or tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of fluids (typically hydrocarbons) under different pressure, volume, and temperature conditions.
This type of analysis is important in understanding the phase behavior, fluid properties, and stability of reservoir fluids.
The files contain functions to calculate properties such as viscosity, phase equilibrium, and bubble point pressure.
The Excel and text files contain input data such as binary interaction parameters (BIP), fluid properties, saturation data, and other relevant information.
Overall, the project's objective is to facilitate PVT analysis and assist in reservoir characterization and production optimization in the oil and gas industry.
